Consider a $k$-class multiclass classification problem with a data distribution
\(\cD\) over \(\reals^d\times\cY\) where \(\reals^d\) is the input domain and
\(\cY\) is the target domain. In a learning problem, an $N$-sized dataset
\(S_N~\cD^N\), known as the training set, is  first sampled i.i.d. from \(\cD\)
and then a neural network \(f_\theta\), parameterized by \(\theta\) is optimized to minimize the empirical loss.
